You can easily deploy your application as a stand-alone server by setting the application HTTP port to 80: using
$ /path/to/bin/<project-name> -Dhttp.port=80

Deploying play application as a standalone server will use a Netty server to serve HHTP requests.
Using a front end HTTP server(Nginx,Apache,Tomcat etc) will rarely give you better performance than using Play server(Netty) directly.
However, HTTP servers are very good at handling HTTPS, conditional GET requests and static assets.

We need to use a a front end HTTP server,
    if you plan to host several applications in the same server or
    load balance several instances of your application for scalability or fault tolerance.

Some good choices for frontend http servers are:
    lighttpd
    nginx
    apache
Refer https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.4.x/HTTPServer to find how to configure these http servers
The basic idea is to run two Play instances of your web application and let the front-end proxy load-balance them.
In case one is not available, it will forward all the requests to the available one.
